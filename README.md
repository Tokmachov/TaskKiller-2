# TaskTracker
This is a task time tracking app.

You use an app in fallowing steps:
1 you create task record.
2 you press start and time you chose for task starts to count down.
3 you receive system notifications when task time is up and chose further actions: you opt in continuing task, you take a time 
for break or you finish task.

to be implemented: 

4 you can inspect time statistics of tracked activity.


Details: 

I noticed that i tend to stray and lose my initial direction after i start doing some tasks. So 
i am in process of designing the app which would help me to keep an eye on the goal and time. 

Textual description of task helps me to clearify the task, the goal. 
Time that i set to describe task helps me be notified when task time is up. So i can feel the time i spent.

Also there are tags. It is easy to describe activities with several tags. 
E.g. i have tags: programming, reading, practice, rest

I can describe some programming tasks as programming + practice, and i can describe reading books about programming as 
programming + reading and if i read for fun it could be reading + rest. 
So when i would want to see the statistics of my activities I could chose programming + practice or programming + reading
or just programming which would join all programming practice and programming reading tasks.
